# Flowering time phenotype data

Number of days following stratification to opening of first flower. The experiment was stopped at 200 d, and accessions that had not flowered at that point were assigned a value of 200. The observed phenotypes are under slightly different growth conditions: 
- SD: days until flowering under short day conditions,
- LD: days until flowering under long day conditions, 
- SDV: days until flowering under short day conditions with vernilization and finally,
- LDV = days until flowering under long day conditions with vernilization.
